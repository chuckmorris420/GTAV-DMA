# GTA V/5 Enhanced Edtion DMA

## This is NOT for FiveM.

This source is not mine, I have just updated the offsets (using a DMA dumper which is included), added some TP buttons and changed the menu ato be cleaner. 

I can probably make the locations be grabbed/saved from a text file along with the offsets to make it easier for non coders to update/edit. A TP manager where you can add your current location and delete existing points would be neat too. I will replace the business buttons with a TP manager and keep the TP buttons for static stuff such as heists or collectables.

All writes present are safe on BE for now.
Inf ammo is a little buggy and can leave you with 0 ammo when it stops being active. Re-toggling will fix.

I will try improve the existing features and then might add some more features once I do the above if I am not burnt out. 

Help is appreciated, suggestions aren't.

Differences in this versus the OG source on UC:
- Changed Direct X example background to black
- Added full screen toggle button
- Changed font to SegoeUI Bold (8 and 0 looked too close)
- Set UI to auto resize to content within them
- Added Business (15 buttons) and Friend business (7 buttons) TP tabs
- Added TP points for inside the casino vault to save time hacking
