This is NOT for FiveM.

This source is not mine, I have just updated the offsets (using a DMA dumper which is included), added some TP buttons and changed the menu ato be cleaner. 
I can probs make the locations be grabbed from a text file along with the offsets to make it easier for non coders to update/edit. A TP manager where you can add your current location and delete existing points would be neat too.

All writes present are safe on BE for now.
Inf ammo is a little buggy and can leave you with 0 ammo when it stops being active. Re-toggling will fix.

I will try improve the existing features and then maybe add some more features once I do the above. 

Help is appreciated, suggestions aren't.
